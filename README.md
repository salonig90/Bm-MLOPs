# BTCUSD RNN Time Series Forecasting Project Plan

This project aims to build a production-ready Machine Learning pipeline for forecasting BTCUSD prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). It incorporates MLOps best practices, including experiment tracking, model registry, CI/CD, drift detection, and business impact analysis through A/B testing and ROI.

## **Project Overview**

Forecasting BTCUSD prices using historical market data with deep learning models (LSTM/GRU). The focus is not just on prediction accuracy but on the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning model in a production environment.

## **Core Components**

### **1. Time Series Forecasting Models**
- **Linear Regression**: A simple baseline model predicting future price based on current market features (Close, Volume, Moving Averages).
- **ARIMA**: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model for univariate time series forecasting.
- **RNN (Optional)**: LSTM/GRU architectures for capturing complex non-linear dependencies (advanced use case).
- **Features**: Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume), technical indicators (RSI, Moving Averages).
- **Objective**: Predict the next-period price or price movement direction.

### **2. MLflow Experiments & Model Registry**
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log hyperparameters, metrics (RMSE, MAE), and model artifacts for every run.
- **Model Registry**: Version control models, transition models through stages (Staging, Production, Archived), and manage model metadata.

### **3. CI/CD for ML (MLOps)**
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated testing of data preprocessing scripts, model training code, and unit tests for model architecture.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploy the best-performing model to a staging or production environment when it passes validation tests.
- **Pipeline Tools**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.

### **4. Drift Detection & Monitoring**
- **Data Drift**: Monitor changes in the distribution of input features (e.g., sudden spikes in volatility or volume).
- **Model Drift**: Detect degradation in model performance (e.g., increasing RMSE) over time.
- **Tools**: Evidently AI, Alibi Detect, or custom monitoring scripts integrated with Prometheus/Grafana.

### **5. Django Dashboard**
- **Visualization**: A central hub to visualize model performance, MLflow experiment summaries, and drift detection reports.
- **A/B Testing Interface**: Manage and monitor live A/B tests between different model versions.
- **ROI Tracking**: Real-time display of financial impact and ROI based on current market predictions.
- **Alerting**: Integrated dashboard alerts for data drift or performance drops.

### **6. A/B Testing & ROI Analysis**
- **A/B Testing**: Compare the performance of the current production model (Control) against a new challenger model (Treatment) in a live or simulated environment.
- **ROI Analysis**: Quantify the financial impact of the model's predictions (e.g., simulated trading profits, risk reduction) to justify the project's value.
